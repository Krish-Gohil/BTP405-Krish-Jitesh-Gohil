## Question 5 (i)
### Approach 1
In the doubleL function declares a list named res and iterates n-1 times in the for loop and multiplies i times 2 in every iteration and appends it into the array

### Approach 2
This approach has the same functionality as approach 1, it just uses list comprehension instead of appending the number in the list in each iteration

### Approach 3
The doubleG function is a generator that uses yield to produce values one at a time. It iterates n-1 times in the for loop, yielding i times 2 in each iteration. When the function is called in the main loop, it generates and returns these doubled values, without storing them all in memory at once.
The advantage of Approach 3 is that it is memory efficient because it generates values one at a time instead of storing them all in a list. This makes it better for handling large datasets or when not all values are needed at once.
